This is project computes the n-th term in a fibonacci sequence in three different manners: (i) Recursively; (ii) Iteractively; (iii) Closed Formula. 
For the first two methods, the entire sequence of terms is returned, even though only the N-th term is shown on the screen. 
As for the latter, only the N-th term is calculated, hence only that is returned.
